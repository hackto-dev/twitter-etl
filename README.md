## Twitter data ETL

- This project is my attempt at creating an ETL pipeline.
- The steps involved are as follow:
  - Extracting Twitter timeline data using developer API.
  - Storing into a pandas df.
  - Automating the whole process using Airflow.
  - Whole process results in Twitter timeline data getting stored into an S3 bucket.
